# CodeQL Security and Vulnerability Scanning
# This workflow performs advanced security analysis to detect:
# - Common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, Path Traversal, etc.)
# - Security anti-patterns and weaknesses
# - Code quality issues that could lead to security problems
# - Dependency vulnerabilities
# - Configuration issues
